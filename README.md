# Stack Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure in C. The stack is implemented using an array with a fixed size, and basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and printing elements are provided.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element onto the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek**: Return the element from the top of the stack without removing it.
- **Print**: Print all elements of the stack.
- **Stack Overflow**: Handle overflow condition when trying to push onto a full stack.
- **Stack Underflow**: Handle underflow condition when trying to pop or peek from an empty stack.

## Usage

To use the stack implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `stack.c` file using a C compiler.
   ```
   gcc stack.c -o stack
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable.
   ```
   ./stack
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to perform stack operations.
